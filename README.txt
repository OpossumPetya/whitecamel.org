The source of whitecamel.org


Currently it has two distinct parts

1) the www/blogs/ is generated by PlanetPlanet running
   planetplanet data/config.ini

2) the www/*.html files and the files in www/p/ 
   are generated by a Perl 6 script called script/static.p6

   In order to run Rakudo we use the PARROT_DIR and RAKUDO_DIR variables.
   We also need to install the Perl6::Conf module from CPAN and to 
   check out the repository of November-wiki 
   (see http://github.com/viklund/november/ )
   so we can use the Perl 6 version of HTML::Template
   We have to configure PERL6LIB so Rakudo will find both Perl6::Conf
   and HTML::Template.

TODO:
   * Write down the history of the award and what the process is deciding who gets it.
     The awards were originally given out by Perl Mongers, Inc but passed
     on to TPF around 2002 when PM merged with them.


   * Collect URLs, rss feeds from the winners
   * Collect countries of residence (when the award was received) ?
   * Update the text on the individual pages (they should somehow 
     include information that shows what did the person do before receiving the
     award and what are newer things). That might preserv the historical
     information.
     Also some of the texts might need to be changed to past tense as people 
     have moved on from various positions or activities.
 
   * Links to the Perl Mongers, YAPCs

   * A photo of the person (make the more easy to recognise at events, make the profile more personal) 
    - provided by the recipient of course and if they don't want to submit one, that's fine.
   * A bio/profile of the person, what they do.  Not all the white camel nominations/award texts tell the whole story, 
     so it could be cool to have 4 - 6 paragraphs from the person about what they do in/for the Perl community
   * A story of how that person got into Perl in the first place,
     and perhaps links to conferences they attend or their local Perl Mongers group.
   * A calendar of forthcoming speaking engagements.

   * Interview with the award winner
