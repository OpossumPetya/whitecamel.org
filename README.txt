The source of whitecamel.org


Currently it has two distinct parts

1) the www/blogs/ is generated by PlanetPlanet running
   planetplanet data/config.ini

2) the www/*.html files and the files in www/p/ 
   are generated by a Perl 6 script called script/static.p6
   It currently uses two hard-coded paths 
   * to the checked out directory of November, the wiki written in Perl 6
     (using HTML::Template from there)
   * the checked out directoru of www.perl.org where we have 
     the original blobs from.


TODO:
   * in some years the award had a cash prize from a sponsor, so we
     should acknowledge those. We could encourage more cash awards.
