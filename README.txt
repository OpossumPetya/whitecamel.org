The source of whitecamel.org


Currently it has two distinct parts

1) the www/blogs/ is generated by PlanetPlanet running
   planetplanet data/config.ini

2) the www/*.html files and the files in www/p/ 
   are generated by a Perl 6 script called script/static.p6

   In order to run Rakudo we use the PARROT_DIR and RAKUDO_DIR variables.
   We also need to install the Perl6::Conf module from CPAN and to 
   check out the repository of November-wiki 
   (see http://github.com/viklund/november/ )
   so we can use the Perl 6 version of HTML::Template
   We have to configure PERL6LIB so Rakudo will find both Perl6::Conf
   and HTML::Template.

TODO:
   * Write down the history of the award and what the process is deciding who gets it.
     The awards were originally given out by Perl Mongers, Inc but passed
     on to TPF around 2002 when PM merged with them.


   * Collect URLs, rss feeds from the winners
   * Collect countries of residence (when the award was received) ?
   * Update the text on the individual pages
