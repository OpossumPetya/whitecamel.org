Jarkko Hietaniemi is a longtime contributor to the Perl language and the
Perl community.  Among his many efforts are creating CPAN, the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.  In his role as CPAN's
Self-Appointed Master Librarian (OOK!), Jarkko has managed the
master CPAN archive since its creation in 1995.  Most Perl
programmers cite CPAN as one of the best features of Perl;
Jarkko's constant dedication is what makes CPAN possible.
