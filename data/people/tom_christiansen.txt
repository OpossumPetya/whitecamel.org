Tom Christiansen has been a Perl evangelist and developer since Perl's initial
release in 1987. He is responsible for much of the documentation that is
provided free-of-charge with the standard Perl distribution. He has an
eagle's eye for finding who's talking about Perl and responds instantly
to anyone treating Perl unfairly. He is tireless in his support and one
of the reasons that Perl is as good as it is.
