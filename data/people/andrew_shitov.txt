If there were a contest for the most Perl events organized, 
Andrew would most likely be the winner. The number of 
conferences isn’t the only category he’d win though. 
He’s not content just to organized conferences in his 
own country, Russia, but also in Bulgaria, the 
Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and many others. 
He’s also win the competition for organizing two 
events the farthest apart: The Second Russian 
Perl Workshop in Vladivostok and YAPC::EU 2011 in Rīga, Latvia. 
That’s still not enough. He’s the moving force behind YAPC::TV, 
which collects videos from Perl events and lets you view them for free. 
For this, we recognize Andrew Shitov for the 2011 White Camel Award for Perl conferences.
