If you’re doing Perl in Japan, you’ve probably run into Daisuke Maki. 
He’s active in Shibuya.pm and many of the YAPC::Asia. He also started 
the Japan Perl Association, the counterpart to The Perl Foundation and 
YAPC::Europe Foundation. For this, we recognize Daisuke Maki for 
the 2011 White Camel Award for Outstanding Contribution to Perl user groups.
