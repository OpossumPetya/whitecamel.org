Fred Moyer has been a fixture in the San Francisco and Bay area Perl community for years, and is the current leader of the <a href="http://sf.pm.org">San Francisco Perl mongers</a>. He's always experimenting with new ways to get people involved with the local community, even if that means inviting people over to his house, manning a booth at a conference, or setting up other events. The community wouldn't be where it is today without the hard work of local organizers.
