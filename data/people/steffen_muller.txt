Steffen MÃ¼ller, also known as tsee, has done quite a bit of technical work for the Perl community, but he's one of the people helping with the non-technical aspects in too many ways to mention. He's especially stood out in recent years with his work through Booking.com, writing for <a href="http://blog.booking.com/author/steffen-muller.html">their technical blog</a> and being a driving force behind <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2015/08/bookingcom-donate-60000-to-per-1.html">Booking.com's generous donations</a> to The <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl_5_core_maintenance_fund">Core Maintenance Fund</a>.
