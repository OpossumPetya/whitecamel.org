Jacinta has been credited for saving more than one Perl Monger group
from dying and is often heralded as the "gardener of the Australian
Perl Community", in the sense that she provides energy while subtly
encouraging others to take responsibility. She is an active member in
every Monger group in Australia, as well as many other FLOSS groups in
the area.  Her resume includes working to organize OSDC,
Linux.conf.au, and SAGE conferences.  She also works with Perl
Training Australia in supporting the Perl community with such ventures
as perl.net.au and Perl Tips.
