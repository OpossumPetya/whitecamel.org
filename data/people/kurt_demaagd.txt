<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2017/08/kurt-demaagd-stepping-down-fro.html">For 17 years</a> Kurt Demaagd handled the boring bits of The Perl Foundation (that's over half of Perl's age now). He was one of the founding board members and the original treasurer (serving 10 years in that role). He moved the money and took care of compliance issuesâ€”tasks not to be underestimated in either their importance or lack of recognition.
