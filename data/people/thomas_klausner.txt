Thomas Klausner ("domm" to many people) of the <a
href="http://vienna.pm.org/">Vienna Perl mongers</a> literally works
harder than everyone else to get to Perl events. Starting in Vienna,
he cycles to many events. He's worked as an organizer for several
workshops in his area (most recently the first Alpine Perl Workshop).
He's a core part of the conference community even if he doesn't boast
about his work.
