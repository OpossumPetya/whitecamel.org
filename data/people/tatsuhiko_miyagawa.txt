Despite his considerable technical contributions to Perl, Miyagawa is
an active community organizer and advocate for Perl. He is so active
in the Perl community that it is rumored that he never sleeps. For the
past three years, he has been one of the main organizers for
YAPC::Asia -- helping that event to break worldwide YAPC attendance
records. He has organized numerous meetings for Shibuya.pm, growing it
to one of the largest Perl Monger groups in existence and frequently
organizes cross-language meetings and events.
