Stas Bekman has been a tireless advocate for large-scale applications
in Perl and, of course, mod_perl. He went from an occasional asker of
questions on the mod_perl list to answering many questions, and had
the forethought to write it all down, creating and maintaining the
mod_perl guide which quickly grew to over 600 pages. Recently, he made
himself available for free talks to Perl Mongers groups during a trip
covering North America, Australia, the Middle East and elsewhere.
