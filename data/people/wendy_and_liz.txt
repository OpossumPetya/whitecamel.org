If you go to enough Perl conferences, especially in Europe, you will eventually cross paths with this pair of Dutch women. You may have seen their collection of hundreds of Perl books, heard the outrageous sums of money they offer at conference auctions, or been the recipient of their quiet (and not so quiet) kindness and attention at workshops, hackathons, YAPCs, FOSDEM, and many other events. Perl is a glue language, and Wendy van Dijk and Liz Mattijsen are glue for the Perl community. Curiously, many people immediately thought of Wendy and Liz as worthy recipients and we were surprised at the number of "no" votes in Mob Rater. It turns out Wendy was stuffing the ballot box to <i>not</i> get the award. That's too bad; no good deed goes unpunished.
