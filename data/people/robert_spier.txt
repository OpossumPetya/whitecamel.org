Robert Spier is one of the volunteer sysadmins for perl.org.  Working
alongside 2001 White Camel recipient Ask Bjorn Hansen, Robert's
unflagging efforts ensure that perl.org's mailing lists, websites,
CVS repositories, mail archives and news servers stay up and
running.  Robert has also taken responsibility for revamping 
bug tracking for Perl by managing RT installations for Perl, as
well as Parrot, CPAN modules and other ancilliary Perl projects.
