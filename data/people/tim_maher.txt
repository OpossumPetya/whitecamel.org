Dr. Tim Maher started and leads the Seattle Perl Users Group (SPUG), 
one of the very first Perl users groups. Since 1998, Tim's efforts 
with SPUG have kept it one of the most vibrant and active groups 
anywhere in the Perl community. Tim has also been instrumental 
in keeping SPUG a friendly place for beginners to come and 
learn Perl, encouraging everyone to share what they learn 
about Perl with the group.
