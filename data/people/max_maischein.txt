Frankfurt.pm hosts the German and the Frankfurt Perl-Workshops and other special events (including YAPC::EU 2012). Max Maischein has been its treasurer since 2011, handling the accounting, reporting, and contracting, as well as coordinating work with other local organizations. Without that important work nothing could get done. He's part of the backbone of the German Perl community.
