Josh McAdams, the host of <a href="http://perlcast.com/">Perlcast</a>
has made quite the name for himself since he exploded into Perl community
about two years ago when he was in Arkansas and started Perlcast,
the first regular podcast about Perl. Since then, he's interviewed
Perl luminaries as well as people connected to the Perl community
and re-vitalized the <a href="http://chicago.pm.org/">Chicago Perl
Mongers</a>.
