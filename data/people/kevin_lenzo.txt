Kevin Lenzo created and sponsored the first Yet Another Perl Conference
(YAPC) to provide a low-cost, grassroots conference for the Perl
community. He led a small group of volunteers who organized a successful
conference for 200 people. YAPC has encouraged the Perl community to
provide more events on an intimate scale and we look forward to Kevin's
YAPC 2000.
