Ask provides many support services for the Perl community including
mailing lists for most lists devoted to Perl, hosting for Perl related
web sites such as dev.perl.org and www.perl.org.  Special thanks to
Ask's employer, <a href="http://www.valueclick.com">ValueClick</a>, for
allowing him to help Perl.
