Andreas Koenig is the creator and maintainer of PAUSE, the Perl Authors
Upload Server.  Since 1995, PAUSE has allowed Perl module authors
to contribute source code to CPAN and share it with the Perl
community.  Additionally, Andreas created the CPAN.pm module,
which allows Perl programmers install modules from their local
CPAN mirror with minimal effort.  Andreas' efforts have been
pivotal in making CPAN the cornerstone of Perl it is today.
