Todd Rinaldo has done plenty of technical work for Perl (you can blame him for taking . out of @INC), but's he's done quite a bit of non-technical work for the community as well. He's helped to organize Perl conferences and hackathons and provided other support through one of Perl's largest financial contributors, cPanel.
