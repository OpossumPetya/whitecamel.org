Barbie is the glue that holds together CPAN Testers, the ad hoc group 
of people who download, test, and report on everything we upload to CPAN. 
Although there are a lot of technical aspects to making this work, 
creating and maintaining the community might be the hardest part of it. 
CPAN Testers success relies on attracting and retaining people who are interested in working with it.
